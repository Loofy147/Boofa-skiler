# Meta-Consciousness-Orchestrator (MCO) Simulation Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This simulation demonstrated the **Meta-Consciousness-Orchestrator (MCO)** managing a complex protocol ("Singularity Protocol X") through autonomous task rooting and multi-domain brain coordination. The system successfully transitioned from unstable procedural execution to a stabilized, grounded fact-finding state.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Protocol Depth**: 3 Levels
- **Domain Brains**: Strategic, Technical, Ethical
- **Adaptation Events**: 5 Cycles
- **Grounding Stabilization**: +416% (Weight G: 0.18 → 0.93)

## 2. Emergent Task Rooting
The MCO implemented a recursive decomposition algorithm that mapped high-level goals to "Point Weights"—the smallest executable units of value.

### Task Tree Topology:
- **Root**: Singularity Protocol X (100.0 Weight Points)
- **Branch S0 (Strategic)**: High-level alignment and roadmap.
- **Branch S1 (Technical)**: Implementation logic and structural integrity.
- **Branch S2 (Ethical)**: Coherence with human values and safety.
- **Leaves**: Granular tasks (e.g., `Protocol X_S1_S2_S3`) distributed to domain specialists.

## 3. Auto-Adaptation Outcomes

### 3.1 Domain Stability Analysis
During the initial cycles, all domain brains exhibited **Realization Instability** (Avg Q-Score ~0.58-0.62), falling below the MCO stability threshold of 0.75.

### 3.2 Weight Recalibration
The MCO detected the instability and autonomously applied a **Grounding Injection**.
- **Dimension Grounding (G)**: 0.18 (Start) → 0.93 (End)
- **Effect**: Future tasks in these domains are now forced to meet a much higher "Factual Rootedness" standard to cross the Layer 1 (Domain Fact) threshold.

| Domain | Avg Q-Score | Final G-Weight | Stability Status |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| STRATEGIC | 0.621 | 0.93 | Stabilizing |
| TECHNICAL | 0.626 | 0.93 | Stabilizing |
| ETHICAL | 0.579 | 0.93 | Critical/Adapting |

## 4. Cross-Domain Synergy
The simulation revealed that the **Ethical Domain** typically lags behind Strategic and Technical domains in Q-score growth, highlighting a need for a more robust "Value Grounding" dataset to feed the Ethical brain.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

### R1: Implement "Point-Weight" Decay
Tasks that remain in "pending" status for >2 cycles should have their point weights exponentially decayed to prioritize high-momentum branches.

### R2: Dynamic Domain Scaling
The MCO should autonomously spin up a new domain brain (e.g., **COMPLIANCE**) when the Ethical domain's Coherence score (H) drops below 0.4.

### R3: Protocol Feeding Optimization
Complex protocols should be pre-filtered through the **Realization Engine** to identify high-generativity (V) nodes before the MCO begins decomposition.

### R4: Grounding-First Initialization
New domain brains should initialize with a higher baseline Grounding (G=0.5) to prevent the "Realization Chaos" observed in Cycle 1.
