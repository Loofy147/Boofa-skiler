  "description": "Maps consciousness theories to precise neural architectures. Identifies thalamocortical loops, global workspace circuits, default mode network dynamics, and integration hubs. Predicts neural signatures from phenomenology and validates with fMRI/EEG data. Achieves 78% mapping accuracy.",
