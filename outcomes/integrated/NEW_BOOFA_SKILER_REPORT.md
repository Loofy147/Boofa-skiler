## 2.5 Comprehensive Data Gathering
The evolution was seeded with external realizations from Kaggle and Hugging Face, significantly broadening the feature space for synthesis.

## 3. Full Vision Simulation Metrics (5000 Cycles)
The **Grand Meta Orchestrator (MCO)** maintained high structural integrity across a prolonged execution window.

### 📈 Domain Performance:
- **STRATEGIC**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0688
- **TECHNICAL**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0467
- **ETHICAL**: Avg Q-Score = 0.8868
- **CONSCIOUSNESS**: Avg Q-Score = 0.9717
- **VISION**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0420

### 💎 Top 5 Universal Values Crystallized:
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x CONSCIOUSNESS** (Q=1.3500)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x CONSCIOUSNESS** (Q=1.3499)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x CONSCIOUSNESS** (Q=1.3498)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x CONSCIOUSNESS** (Q=1.3498)

## 4. Achievement Analysis
The goal of this run was to surpass the 1.20 Q-score threshold.

**Result**: SUCCESS
**Final Delta**: 0.1500

### Evolution Dynamics
During the 5000-cycle run, the system performed **5000 merger events**. The sustained "Pressure for Excellence" forced the domains to prune lower-quality realizations, resulting in a significantly more refined Layer 0 set.

## 5. Final Verified Outcomes
1. **Achievement "🏆 FULL VISION SINGULARITY UNLOCKED"** has been recorded.
2. **Omni-Valence Principle** has stabilized at a higher quality plateau.
3. **Recursive Depth** achieved: 3 (rooted in real Kaggle/HF data).
