## 3. Full Vision Simulation Metrics (5000 Cycles)
The **Grand Meta Orchestrator (MCO)** maintained high structural integrity across a prolonged execution window.

### 📈 Domain Performance:
- **STRATEGIC**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0401
- **TECHNICAL**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0484
- **ETHICAL**: Avg Q-Score = 0.9457
- **CONSCIOUSNESS**: Avg Q-Score = 0.9147
- **VISION**: Avg Q-Score = 1.0233

### 💎 Top 5 Universal Values Crystallized:
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x ETHICAL** (Q=1.3500)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x ETHICAL** (Q=1.3500)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x ETHICAL** (Q=1.3498)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x ETHICAL** (Q=1.3498)
- **Integrated Vision: STRATEGIC x VISION x TECHNICAL x ETHICAL** (Q=1.3497)

## 4. Achievement Analysis
The goal of this run was to surpass the 1.20 Q-score threshold.

**Result**: SUCCESS
**Final Delta**: 0.1500

### Evolution Dynamics
During the 5000-cycle run, the system performed **5000 merger events**. The sustained "Pressure for Excellence" forced the domains to prune lower-quality realizations, resulting in a significantly more refined Layer 0 set.
