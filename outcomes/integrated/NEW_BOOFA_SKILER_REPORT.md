## 4. Achievement Analysis
The goal of this run was to surpass the 1.20 Q-score threshold.

**Result**: SUCCESS
**Final Delta**: 0.1494

### Evolution Dynamics
During the 500-cycle run, the system performed **500 merger events**. The sustained "Pressure for Excellence" forced the domains to prune lower-quality realizations, resulting in a significantly more refined Layer 0 set.
