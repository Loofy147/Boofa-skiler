# 🤖 Boofa-Skiler: High-Q Autonomous Intelligence Framework

Boofa-Skiler is a recursive, self-evolving cognitive architecture designed for high-integrity strategic synthesis and technical excellence.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **6-Layered Cognitive Architecture**: From Universal Rules (L0) to Consciousness Modeling (L5).
- **Q-Score Governance**: Rigorous quality measurement based on Grounding, Certainty, Structure, Applicability, Coherence, and Generativity.
- **Architectural Services Hub**: Standalone services for Realization, Audit, and Discovery.
- **Agentic Workflow**: Recursive Audit-Refine loops specialized for medical (Boofa-Med) and mathematical (AIMO) domains.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. **Architecture**: Explore `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. **Roadmap**: Check `docs/MASTER_ROADMAP_CHECKLIST.md` for Phase 7 progress.
3. **Execution**: Use `layers/layer_4_discovery/master_outcome_generator.py` for system evolution.

## 🧪 Verification
Run the comprehensive test suite to ensure High-Q stability:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
python3 tests/verify_aimo_performance.py
python3 tests/full_system_test.py
python3 tests/test_medgemma_workflow.py
```
