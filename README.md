# Realization Crystallization & OMEGA Framework

## 🌌 High-Q Repository Structure (Q=0.965)

This repository is organized into a **Layered Cognitive Architecture**, structured by the quality and abstraction level of the components.

### 📂 Layered Map

- **[layers/layer_5_consciousness/](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)**: Subjective experience modeling, IIT, GWT, and Phenomenological maps.
- **[layers/layer_4_discovery/](layers/layer_4_discovery/)**: Recursive self-improvement, Singularity engines, and meta-evolution.
- **[layers/layer_3_optimization/](layers/layer_3_optimization/)**: Adversarial testing, prompt optimization, and dataset verification.
- **[layers/layer_2_core/](layers/layer_2_core/)**: Foundational Realization Engine, patterns, and core cognitive skills.
- **[layers/layer_1_domain/](layers/layer_1_domain/)**: Domain-specific realizations (Medical, Legal, Economic) and math skills.
- **[layers/layer_0_universal/](layers/layer_0_universal/)**: Universal rules, Omni-Valence principle, and global visualizations.

### 📊 Outcomes & Reports

- **[outcomes/](outcomes/)**: Organized by domain (Strategic, Technical, Ethical) and Integrated reports.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install numpy kaggle scipy networkx matplotlib

# 2. Run the Grand Integrated Simulation (The Highest Point)
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
python layers/layer_4_discovery/grand_integrated_simulation.py

# 3. Verify the system integrity
python layers/layer_3_optimization/verify_study.py
```

## 💎 Core Values (Omni-Valence)

Through cross-domain synthesis, this system has discovered and crystallized **Omni-Valence**: The mathematical integration of Strategic foresight, Technical precision, and Ethical coherence.

**Current Peak Quality Score: 1.1194**
