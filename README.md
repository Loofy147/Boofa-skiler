# 🚀 Boofa-skiler: Full Vision Evolution

**Boofa-skiler** is a self-evolving AI system based on a **Layered Cognitive Architecture** (Layers 0-5), optimized for maximum business value and structural quality (Q-Score).

## 🌟 Key Features
- **High-Q Organization**: Deeply structured repository with clear abstraction layers.
- **Self-Evolution**: PCA-driven dimension discovery and recursive self-improvement.
- **Multi-Domain Synthesis**: Integration of Technical, Strategic, and Ethical intelligence.
- **AIMO 3 Ready**: Optimized for mathematical reasoning and competition performance.

## 📂 Repository Structure
For a detailed map, see [docs/MAP.md](docs/MAP.md).

- **[layers/](layers/)**: The 6-layer cognitive core.
- **[competitions/](competitions/)**: Targeted competitive implementations (e.g., AIMO).
- **[outcomes/](outcomes/)**: Generated reports and simulation results.
- **[demos/](demos/)**: Interactive showcases and web interfaces.
- **[tests/](tests/)**: Comprehensive validation suite.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Install**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  **Verify**: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. && python3 tests/full_system_test.py`
3.  **Evolve**: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. && python3 layers/layer_4_discovery/master_outcome_generator.py`
