In many\napplication scenarios it is important that goal recognition algorithms can\nrecognize goals of an observed agent as fast as possible and with minimal\ndomain knowledge. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method for online\ngoal recognition that combines a symbolic planning landmark based approach and\na data-driven goal recognition approach and evaluate it in a real-world cooking\nscenario. The empirical results show that the proposed method is not only\nsignificantly more efficient in terms of computation time than the\nstate-of-the-art but also improves goal recognition performance. Furthermore,\nwe show that the utilized planning landmark based approach, which was so far\nonly evaluated on artificial benchmark domains, achieves also good recognition\nperformance when ap...",
