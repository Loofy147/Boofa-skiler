--- Example 1 ---
Problem: In 1988, a person's age was equal to the sum of the digits of their birth year. How old was this person?
Solution: To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Let the person's birth year be \( Y \).
2. In 1988, the person's age would be \( 1988 - Y \).
3. The sum of the digits of \( Y \) should be equal to their age in 1988.

Therefore, we need to find a year \( Y \) such that:

\[ 1988 - Y = \text{sum of the digits of } Y \]

We can solve this by iterating through possible values for \( Y \) and checking if the condition holds.

Let's write a Python script to find the correct birth year \( Y \).
```python
def digit_sum(year):
    """Calculate the sum of the digits of a year."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(year))

def find_birth_year():
print((    for year in range(1900, 1989):))  # Reasonable range given the
```
```output
Cell In[210], line 6
    for year in range(1900, 1989):  # Reasonable range given the
                                                                ^
SyntaxError: incomplete input
```
It looks like the code was cut off prematurely. Let me continue with the complete code included.

We'll define a function to compute the digit sum and then iterate over possible birth years within a reasonable range to find the correct year that satisfies the condition.
```python
def digit_sum(year):
    """Calculate the sum of the digits of a year."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(year))

def find_birth_year():
    for year in range(1900, 1989):  # Reasonable range given the context
        age_in_1988 = 1988 - year
        if age_in_1988 == digit_sum(year):
            return age_in_1988

age_1988 = find_birth_year()
print(age_1988)
```
```output
22
```
The person's age in 1988 was \( \boxed{22} \).

--- Example 2 ---
Problem: Let $n = 2^4 \cdot 3^5 \cdot 4^6\cdot 6^7$. How many natural-number factors does $n$ have?
Solution: The problem involves determining the number of natural-number factors of a given integer \( n \). The given integer \( n \) is:

\[
n = 2^4 \cdot 3^5 \cdot 4^6 \cdot 6^7
\]

First, let's express the number \( n \) in terms of its prime factors.

- \( 4 \) can be written as \( 2^2 \), so \( 4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12} \).
- \( 6 \) can be written as \( 2 \cdot 3 \), so \( 6^7 = (2 \cdot 3)^7 = 2^7 \cdot 3^7 \).

Therefore, combining these, we have:

\[
n = 2^4 \cdot 3^5 \cdot 2^{12} \cdot 2^7 \cdot 3^7
\]

Next, we add the exponents of each prime factor:

\[
n = 2^{4 + 12 + 7} \cdot 3^{5 + 7} = 2^{23} \cdot 3^{12}
\]

Now, to find the number of natural-number factors of \( n \), we use the formula that
if \( n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of factors of \( n \) is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \).

So, for \( n = 2^{23} \cdot 3^{12} \), the number of factors is:

\[
(23 + 1)(12 + 1)
\]

Now let's compute this using Python:
```python
# Given the exponents
exp_2 = 23
exp_3 = 12

# Number of natural-number factors
num_factors = (exp_2 + 1) * (exp_3 + 1)
print(num_factors)
```
```output
312
```
The number of natural-number factors of \( n \) is \(\boxed{312}\).
