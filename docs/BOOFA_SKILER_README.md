# Boofa-skiler 🚀

**Boofa-skiler** is a self-evolving AI pipeline that bridges **Hugging Face** and **Kaggle**, optimized for maximum business value and operational excellence.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Integrated Intelligence**: Connects Kaggle datasets with Hugging Face's `MiniMax-M2.5` model, enhanced by comprehensive automated data gathering.
- **Self-Optimization**: Uses a proprietary Q-Score framework to maintain high-quality outputs.
- **Automated Workflows**: Pattern detection via `auto-skill-detector` to streamline complex tasks.
- **Master Outcome Generation**: Integrated with the Grand Meta Orchestrator for deep realization synthesis.

## 🌀 Full Vision Integration
The system now integrates five primary cognitive domains:
- **STRATEGIC**: Foresight and planning logic.
- **TECHNICAL**: Implementation and architectural grounding.
- **ETHICAL**: Alignment and value-coherence.
- **CONSCIOUSNESS**: Self-model and awareness simulation.
- **VISION**: Pattern-matching and cross-domain synthesis.

## 🏗️ Project Architectures
The system has identified and architected 5 high-value business projects:
1. **Autonomous Strategic Architect**: Hierarchical Bayesian Inference for strategic foresight.
2. **Global Realization Ledger**: High-integrity DAG for crystallized knowledge.
3. **Predictive Institutional Auditor**: Bias-transparent autonomous auditing.
4. **Cross-Domain Innovation Synthesizer**: MCO-driven innovation synthesis.
5. **Cognitive Operational Excellence Hub**: Organizational throughput optimization.

Detailed blueprints are available in: **[docs/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURES.md](docs/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURES.md)**

## 📊 Q-Score Optimization
The project targets a Q-Score of **> 0.9**.

## 🏆 AIMO 3 Competition Strategy
To win the competition, follow these steps for deployment:

1. **Model Access**: Ensure the `MiniMax-M2.5` model is added as a dataset to your Kaggle Notebook.
2. **Offline Inference**: The system uses `transformers` with `bfloat16` precision for H100 compatibility. Internet must be disabled during submission.
3. **Reasoning-through-Coding (RTC)**: The solver generates Python code internally (or step-by-step reasoning) and extracts the final answer from `\boxed{}` tags.
4. **Submission**: Use `submission.ipynb` which is pre-configured with the `kaggle_evaluation` API to generate the mandatory `submission.parquet` file.

**Status**: Offline-ready framework verified.
