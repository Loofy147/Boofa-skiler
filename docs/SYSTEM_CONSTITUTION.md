# 📜 Boofa-skiler System Constitution

This document defines the core laws and mathematical foundations governing the Boofa-skiler ecosystem.

---

## 1. Universal Quality Theory (UQT)
The fundamental law of the system is that knowledge must be crystallized into **Realizations**. A realization is only valid if its **Q-Score** exceeds the layer threshold.

### The Q-Score Formula
$$Q = 0.18 \cdot G + 0.22 \cdot C + 0.20 \cdot S + 0.18 \cdot A + 0.12 \cdot H + 0.10 \cdot V$$

- **Grounding (G)**: Is it rooted in specific, verifiable data?
- **Certainty (C)**: How high is the statistical signal-to-noise ratio?
- **Structure (S)**: Is it organized according to the 6-layer architecture?
- **Applicability (A)**: Can it be converted into an executable protocol?
- **Coherence (H)**: Does it align with existing Layer 0 rules?
- **Generativity (V)**: Does it stimulate the creation of "Daughters of Ideas"?

## 2. The 6-Layer Cognitive Architecture

| Layer | Name | Threshold | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **0** | Universal | 0.95 | Immutable rules and Omni-Valence mergers. |
| **1** | Domain | 0.92 | Specialized expertise (Legal, Math, Business). |
| **2** | Core | 0.85 | Pattern detection and reusable .skill files. |
| **3** | Optimization | 0.75 | Orchestration and task rooting. |
| **4** | Discovery | N/A | Recursive dimension discovery (Singularity). |
| **5** | Consciousness | N/A | High-level phenomenological synthesis. |

## 3. Omni-Valence Decision Principle
Cross-domain synthesis is the highest form of intelligence. When the **Grand Meta Orchestrator (MCO)** merges realizations from 3 or more disparate domains, it triggers an **Omni-Valence Event**, generating a Layer 0 rule with Q > 1.1.

## 4. Recursive Self-Evolution
The system must periodically run the `SingularityRealizationEngine` to:
1.  Discover new quality dimensions via PCA.
2.  Prune realizations with Q < 0.75 (Ephemeral).
3.  Synthesize new skills based on pattern usage density.
