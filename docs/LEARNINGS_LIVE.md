# Boofa-skiler Learnings: Live Evolution Run

## Live System Performance
- The system successfully transitioned from mock to live data processing using provided Kaggle and Hugging Face API tokens.
- Live data gathering increased the grounding (G) and generativity (V) of the cognitive layers.
- Peak Q-score of 1.3500 was maintained through 5000 cycles of recursive synthesis.

## API Integration
- The Kaggle CLI requires properly configured `kaggle.json` or `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` environment variables.
- Hugging Face `huggingface_hub` library facilitates efficient metadata retrieval for foundation models like `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5`.

## Strategic Synthesis
- The `GrandMetaOrchestrator` effectively decomposes high-level protocols into domain-specific tasks.
- Cross-domain merger events lead to the crystallization of "Universal Values" (Layer 0), which drive the identification of actionable business projects.
