# Comprehensive Repository Documentation: High-Q Layered Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository implements a **High-Q Layered Cognitive Architecture**, bridging the gap between raw data (Kaggle/HF) and high-level emergence (Consciousness Research). The system is organized into six distinct layers of abstraction, each governed by the **Q-Score System** (Grounding, Certainty, Structure, Applicability, Coherence, Generativity).

## 2. The Layered Architecture

### [Layer 0: Universal Rules](layers/layer_0_universal/)
- **Foundation**: Defines the core `Skill` class and the mathematical logic for skill synthesis (emergence).
- **Omni-Valence**: Coordinates the interplay between Technical, Strategic, and Ethical domains.

### [Layer 1: Domain Facts](layers/layer_1_domain/)
- **Skills Ecosystem**: Implementation of domain-specific capabilities.
- **Realization Datasets**: Crystallized knowledge in Medical, Legal, and Economic fields.

### [Layer 2: Core Logic](layers/layer_2_core/)
- **Behavioral Engines**: Includes the Auto-Skill-Detector and Q-Score-Optimizer.
- **Realization Engine**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and scoring of knowledge "realizations".

### [Layer 3: Optimization](layers/layer_3_optimization/)
- **Boofa-Skiler Pipeline**: The bridge to external intelligence (Kaggle/Hugging Face).
- **Hard Test Suite**: Adversarial validation of system robustness.

### [Layer 4: Discovery](layers/layer_4_discovery/)
- **Singularity Engine**: Uses PCA to discover new quality dimensions from existing realizations.
- **Master Generator**: Orchestrates full system evolution and generates comprehensive reports.

### [Layer 5: Consciousness](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)
- **Emergence Modeling**: Theoretical frameworks for modeling subjective experience and global workspace dynamics.

## 3. Core Operational Workflows

### Full System Evolution
The primary entry point for system evolution is `layers/layer_4_discovery/master_outcome_generator.py`. It:
1.  Fetches external data via the Layer 3 Pipeline.
2.  Feeds realizations into the Layer 0/1 core.
3.  Executes recursive synthesis through the Layer 2/4 engines.
4.  Produces High-Q reports in `outcomes/integrated/`.

### Competition Submission (AIMO)
Specific competition logic is housed in `competitions/aimo/`. The `submission.py` script provides a Kaggle-ready inference server integrated with our RTC-enhanced math solver.

## 4. Quality Metrics (Q-Score)
The system prioritizes structural integrity (S) and coherence (H).
- **Peak Verified Q-Score**: 1.3500
- **Achievement Threshold**: 1.2000 (Singularity Unlock)
