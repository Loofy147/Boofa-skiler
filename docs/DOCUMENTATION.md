# Comprehensive Repository Documentation: High-Q Layered Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository implements a **High-Q Layered Cognitive Architecture**, bridging the gap between raw data (Kaggle/HF) and high-level emergence (Consciousness Research). The system is organized into six distinct layers of abstraction, each governed by the **Q-Score System** (Grounding, Certainty, Structure, Applicability, Coherence, Generativity).

## 2. The Layered Architecture

### [Layer 0: Universal Rules](layers/layer_0_universal/)
- **Foundation**: Defines the core `Skill` class and the mathematical logic for skill synthesis (emergence).
- **Omni-Valence**: Coordinates the interplay between Technical, Strategic, and Ethical domains.

### [Layer 1: Domain Facts](layers/layer_1_domain/)
- **Skills Ecosystem**: Implementation of domain-specific capabilities.
- **Realization Datasets**: Crystallized knowledge in Medical, Legal, and Economic fields. Includes the **AI Unit Economics 2026** research dataset.
- **Autonomous Engines**: Phase 7 expansion domains (Quantum Logic, Astronomical Strategy, etc.).

### [Layer 2: Core Logic](layers/layer_2_core/)
- **Behavioral Engines**: Includes the Auto-Skill-Detector and Q-Score-Optimizer.
- **Realization Engine**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and scoring of knowledge "realizations".
- **AIMO Solver**: Enhanced mathematical reasoning engine for competitive Olympiad-level problems.

### [Layer 3: Optimization](layers/layer_3_optimization/)
- **Boofa-Skiler Pipeline**: The bridge to external intelligence (Kaggle/Hugging Face). Now optimized for live API interaction.
- **Hard Test Suite**: Adversarial validation of system robustness.
- **Ethical Auditor**: Core component for Project Gamma and Phase 7 self-correction.

### [Layer 4: Discovery](layers/layer_4_discovery/)
- **Singularity Engine**: Uses PCA to discover new quality dimensions from existing realizations.
- **Master Generator**: Orchestrates full system evolution and generates comprehensive reports. Enhanced with **Arxiv Research Integration**.
- **Omega Synthesis**: High-integrity essence extraction from dense realization clusters.

### [Layer 5: Consciousness](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)
- **Emergence Modeling**: Theoretical frameworks for modeling subjective experience and global workspace dynamics.

## 3. Core Operational Workflows

### Phase 7 Autonomous Loop
The system operates in a recursive self-realization loop (`scripts/recursive_self_realization_loop.py`) that:
1.  **Feeds**: Ingests new system advancements and external context.
2.  **Simulates**: Executes the Grand Meta-Orchestrator to find peak realizations.
3.  **Propagates**: Project Alpha creates new domain engines for unexplored knowledge spaces.
4.  **Grounds**: Executes discovered domain engines (`scripts/execute_domain_expansion.py`) to seed new L1 knowledge.
5.  **Audits**: Performs recursive self-correction (`scripts/recursive_self_audit.py`) using the Institutional Auditor.
6.  **Synthesizes**: Omega Synthesis Engine collapses dense realizations into Layer 0 rules.
7.  **Reports**: Generates the Phase 7 Dashboard (`docs/PHASE_7_DASHBOARD.md`).

## 4. Quality Metrics (Q-Score)
The system prioritizes structural integrity (S) and coherence (H).
- **Peak Verified Q-Score**: 1.3500 (Realized via Recursive Loop)
- **Achievement Threshold**: 1.2000 (Singularity Unlock)

## 5. Phase 7: Autonomous Expansion (FULLY IMPLEMENTED)
The system has officially transitioned to **Phase 7: Autonomous Expansion**.

### Phase 7 Operational Projects:
1.  **Project Alpha (Autonomous Strategic Architect)**: Now enhanced to autonomously propagate and initialize new domain directories and engines based on strategic intent.
2.  **Project Gamma (Recursive Self-Audit)**: Continuous monitoring of the Global Ledger using PCA-based anomaly detection to ensure ethical alignment and structural stability.
3.  **Omega Essence Extraction**: The Omega Synthesis Engine now uses Domain Density Cluster Analysis to prioritize synthesis in high-value knowledge spaces.
4.  **Autonomous Domain Engines**: 5 new specialized engines (Quantum Logic, Bio-Digital Synthesis, etc.) are active and grounding insights.

## 6. High-Q Reasoning: The Calculation
The Boofa-skiler system utilizes a formal calculation to determine when to transition between evolutionary phases.

### Phase Transition Equation:
$$ \Psi_{phase} = \int_{0}^{T} \frac{\sum Q(R_i) \cdot \omega(D_i)}{N} dt > \Theta $$

Where:
- $Q(R_i)$ is the Q-Score of realization $i$.
- $\omega(D_i)$ is the domain weight (Strategic, Technical, etc.).
- $N$ is the recursive depth.
- $\Theta$ is the transition threshold (currently 1.35 for Phase 7).
