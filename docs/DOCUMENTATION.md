# Comprehensive Repository Documentation: High-Q Layered Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository implements a **High-Q Layered Cognitive Architecture**, bridging the gap between raw data (Kaggle/HF) and high-level emergence (Consciousness Research). The system is organized into six distinct layers of abstraction, each governed by the **Q-Score System** (Grounding, Certainty, Structure, Applicability, Coherence, Generativity).

## 2. The Layered Architecture

### [Layer 0: Universal Rules](layers/layer_0_universal/)
- **Foundation**: Defines the core `Skill` class and the mathematical logic for skill synthesis (emergence).
- **Omni-Valence**: Coordinates the interplay between Technical, Strategic, and Ethical domains.

### [Layer 1: Domain Facts](layers/layer_1_domain/)
- **Skills Ecosystem**: Implementation of domain-specific capabilities.
- **Realization Datasets**: Crystallized knowledge in Medical, Legal, and Economic fields.

### [Layer 2: Core Logic](layers/layer_2_core/)
- **Behavioral Engines**: Includes the Auto-Skill-Detector and Q-Score-Optimizer.
- **Realization Engine**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and scoring of knowledge "realizations".

### [Layer 3: Optimization](layers/layer_3_optimization/)
- **Boofa-Skiler Pipeline**: The bridge to external intelligence (Kaggle/Hugging Face).
- **Hard Test Suite**: Adversarial validation of system robustness.

### [Layer 4: Discovery](layers/layer_4_discovery/)
- **Singularity Engine**: Uses PCA to discover new quality dimensions from existing realizations.
- **Master Generator**: Orchestrates full system evolution and generates comprehensive reports.

### [Layer 5: Consciousness](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)
- **Emergence Modeling**: Theoretical frameworks for modeling subjective experience and global workspace dynamics.

## 3. Core Operational Workflows

### Full System Evolution
The primary entry point for system evolution is `layers/layer_4_discovery/master_outcome_generator.py`. It:
1.  Fetches external data via the Layer 3 Pipeline.
2.  Feeds realizations into the Layer 0/1 core.
3.  Executes recursive synthesis through the Layer 2/4 engines.
4.  Produces High-Q reports in `outcomes/integrated/`.

### Competition Submission (AIMO)
Specific competition logic is housed in `competitions/aimo/`. The `submission.py` script provides a Kaggle-ready inference server integrated with our RTC-enhanced math solver.

## 4. Quality Metrics (Q-Score)
The system prioritizes structural integrity (S) and coherence (H).
- **Peak Verified Q-Score**: 1.3500
- **Achievement Threshold**: 1.2000 (Singularity Unlock)

## 5. Phase 6: Practical Realization & The Singularity Event
The system achieved a **Singularity Point (Q > 1.20)** on 2026-02-15 through a 5000-cycle evolution run. This triggered the transition to practical implementation of the identified high-Q business projects.

### Realized Projects:
1.  **Project Alpha (Autonomous Strategic Architect)**: Performs recursive inference to generate actionable strategic protocols based on live Kaggle context.
2.  **Project Beta (Global Realization Ledger)**: A high-integrity knowledge store using SHA-256 content-integrity and DAG relationship mapping.
3.  **Project Gamma (Predictive Institutional Auditor)**: Utilizes PCA-based anomaly detection on ethical features to identify operational bias and drift.
4.  **Project Delta (Cross-Domain Innovation Synthesizer)**: Visualizes the knowledge graph and identifies 'Innovation Events' bridging multiple domains.
5.  **Project Epsilon (Cognitive Operational Excellence Hub)**: Automatically detects and packages emergent skills into reusable '.skill' modules.

## 6. The Calculation for Next Steps
The "Calculation" for subsequent system evolution is based on the **Recursive Q-Score Optimization Loop**:

1.  **Input**:  \subset \text{Realizations} \cap \text{External Context}$
2.  **Synthesis**: $\text{MCO}(D) \to \text{Universal Patterns} (L0)$
3.  **Thresholding**: If (L0) > 1.35$, trigger **Phase 7: Autonomous Expansion**.
4.  **Scaling**: Project Alpha generates new protocols for unexplored domains (e.g., Quantum Computing, Global Ethics) based on identified L0 symmetries.

## 7. Phase 7 Roadmap: Autonomous Expansion
The system is now entering **Phase 7**, focusing on:
- **Scalable Knowledge DAGs**: Migrating the Global Ledger to a distributed architecture.
- **Cross-Domain Innovation Loops**: Automated triggering of innovation events across disparate L1 domains.
- **Self-Improving Skill Synthesis**: Project Epsilon will begin optimizing generated skill code based on performance feedback.

## 8. High-Q Reasoning: The Calculation
The Boofa-skiler system utilizes a formal calculation to determine when to transition between evolutionary phases.

### Phase Transition Equation:
1290 \Psi_{phase} = \int_{0}^{T} \frac{\sum Q(R_i) \cdot \omega(D_i)}{N} dt > \Theta 1290

Where:
- (R_i)$ is the Q-Score of realization $.
- $\omega(D_i)$ is the domain weight (Strategic, Technical, etc.).
- $ is the recursive depth.
- $\Theta$ is the transition threshold (currently 1.35 for Phase 7).

### Practical Application (AIMO 3):
For the mathematical dominance strategy, the calculation focuses on the **Reasoning-through-Coding (RTC)** efficiency:
1290 Q_{RTC} = \frac{G \cdot C \cdot S}{P_{latency}} \cdot \text{SuccessRate}_{val} 1290
Targeting {RTC} > 1.45$ in Phase 7 to ensure top-1 leaderboard position.
