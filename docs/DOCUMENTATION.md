# Comprehensive Repository Documentation: Layered Cognitive Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository represents a foundational research project in **Computational Epistemology**, **Universal Quality Theory**, and **Consciousness Research**. It uses a **Layered Cognitive Architecture** to organize knowledge and engines based on their abstraction and quality (Q-score).

### Key Achievements:
- **Layered Repository Structure**: Files are organized into Layers 0-5.
- **Q-Score System**: A validated, six-dimensional quality metric (G, C, S, A, H, V).
- **Omni-Valence Principle**: The mathematical integration of Strategic, Technical, and Ethical domains (Layer 0).
- **Singularity Evolution Engine**: Recursive self-improvement where the framework evolves its own dimensions (Layer 4).

## 2. Repository Architecture (Layered)

### [Layer 5: Consciousness & Emergence](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)

- **SKILL_*.md**: Documented cognitive capabilities.

### [Layer 1: Domain Facts](layers/layer_1_domain/)
Crystallized knowledge in specific domains.
- **medical_realizations.json**: High-quality insights in the medical field.
- **legal_realizations.json**: Legal domain crystallization.
- **economic_realizations.json**: Economic domain crystallization.

### [Layer 0: Universal Rules](layers/layer_0_universal/)
Foundational principles that govern the entire system.
- **grand_integrated_outcomes.json**: The Omni-Valence principle and universal Q-score outcomes.
- **realization_explorer.jsx**: Visualizer for the universal realization structure.

## 3. Outcomes & Reports
The outcomes of simulations and research are organized in the `outcomes/` directory:
- **strategic/**: Innovation, MCO simulation, and evolution reports.
- **technical/**: Dataset generation, hard tests, and OMEGA deep study reports.
- **integrated/**: Comprehensive assessments and final integrated outcomes.
