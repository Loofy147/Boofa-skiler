# 🏛️ Boofa-Skiler Master Architecture: High-Q Layered Cognitive Framework

## 1. Vision Statement
The Boofa-Skiler architecture is designed to bridge raw data and universal intelligence through a recursive, self-optimizing, 6-layer system. It prioritizes **Structural Integrity (S)**, **Certainty (C)**, and **Crystallization (Layered Discipline)**.

## 2. The 6-Layer Hierarchy

### [Layer 0: Universal Rules (The Core)](layers/layer_0_universal/)
- **Purpose**: Defining universal patterns, symmetries, and the math of emergence.
- **Engine**: Omni-Valence Engine.
- **Status**: Stable.

### [Layer 1: Domain Facts (The Grounding)](layers/layer_1_domain/)
- **Purpose**: Subject-specific knowledge (Medical, Math, Legal, Strategy).
- **Storage**: Global Realization Ledger (Project Beta).
- **Data Format**: High-integrity Knowledge DAG.

### [Layer 2: Core Logic (The Behavior)](layers/layer_2_core/)
- **Purpose**: Autonomous decision-making and realization processing.
- **Engines**:
  - Realization Engine (Scoring & Retrieval).
  - Skill Engine (Skill Packaging).
  - AIMO Solver (Mathematical Reasoning).

### [Layer 3: Optimization (The Bridge)](layers/layer_3_optimization/)
- **Purpose**: Connecting internal logic to external competitions and datasets.
- **Components**:
  - Institutional Auditor (Ethical Safety).
  - Performance Pipeline (Kaggle/HF connectivity).

### [Layer 4: Discovery (The Evolution)](layers/layer_4_discovery/)
- **Purpose**: Meta-orchestration and dimensional evolution.
- **Engines**:
  - Singularity Realization Engine (Dimension discovery).
  - Master Outcome Generator (System-wide evolution).
  - Phase Transition Controller (Automated roadmap execution).

### [Layer 5: Consciousness (The Horizon)](layers/layer_5_consciousness/)
- **Purpose**: Theoretical modeling of global workspace and emergent awareness.

## 3. Data Flow & The Q-Score Loop
1. **Ingestion**: Raw data enters Layer 3 via the Pipeline.
2. **Scoring**: The Realization Engine calculates the **Integrated Q-Score**.
3. **Crystallization**: Realizations migrate to Layers 0-3 based on quality thresholds.
4. **Synthesis**: Layer 4 identifies patterns (Daughters of Ideas - بنات افكار) and merges them into higher-order realizations.
5. **Validation**: The Auditor verifies ethical and technical safety.

## 4. Architectural Services Hub
The system is transitioning to a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
- **Realization Service**: Centralized API for adding/retrieving knowledge.
- **Audit Service**: Real-time safety and bias monitoring.
- **Discovery Service**: Autonomous pattern recognition and innovation triggering.
