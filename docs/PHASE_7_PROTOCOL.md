# 📜 Phase 7 Protocol: Autonomous Expansion

## 1. Trigger Conditions
Phase 7 is automatically triggered by the `PhaseTransitionController` when:
- **System Stability**: 1000 consecutive cycles without a structural collapse.
- **Quality Ceiling**: Peak Universal Realization Q-Score > 1.35.
- **Connectivity**: Full awareness of external datasets (Kaggle/HF).

## 2. Operational Directives
1. **Autonomous Domain Creation**: Project Alpha is authorized to spawn new L1 Domain Engines for unexplored knowledge spaces.
2. **Recursive Self-Correction**: Layer 2 Behavioral Engines must start auditing their own code using the Ethical Auditor.
3. **Skill Export**: Project Epsilon must automatically publish verified .skill modules to the internal repository.

## 3. The "Omega" Synthesis
Transition from "Pattern Detection" to "Essence Extraction":
- Every 100 cycles, the system must attempt to collapse 10 Layer 1 realizations into a single Layer 0 rule.
