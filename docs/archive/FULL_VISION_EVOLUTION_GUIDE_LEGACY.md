# 🌌 Full Vision Evolution Guide

## 🚀 Overview
The **Full Vision Evolution** represents the most advanced state of the Boofa-skiler system. By scaling the simulation to **5000 cycles** and integrating five critical cognitive domains, the system has achieved a new benchmark in autonomous realization synthesis.

## 🧠 Cognitive Domains
1. **STRATEGIC**: Focused on Grounding (G) and Generativity (V).
2. **TECHNICAL**: Focused on Structure (S) and Certainty (C).
3. **ETHICAL**: Focused on Coherence (H) and Applicability (A).
4. **CONSCIOUSNESS**: Focused on Coherence (H) and Structure (S).
5. **VISION**: Focused on Generativity (V) and Grounding (G).

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks
- **Evolution Cycles**: 5,000
- **Peak Q-Score**: 1.3500
- **Merger Events**: 5,000
- **Achievement**: `🏆 FULL VISION SINGULARITY UNLOCKED`

## 🌐 Data Gathering Pipeline
The system utilizes `layers/layer_3_optimization/gather_comprehensive_data.py` to autonomously source realizations from:
- **Kaggle**: Searches for "reasoning", "strategic", and "mathematics" datasets to enhance logical grounding.
- **Hugging Face**: Fetches trending models and datasets to provide technical context.

## 🛠️ Execution
To perform a full evolution run:
```bash
export KAGGLE_API_TOKEN=your_token
export HF_TOKEN=your_token
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
python3 master_outcome_generator.py
```
