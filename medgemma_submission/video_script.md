# 🎥 Boofa-Med: Competition Video Script (3 Minutes)

## **Part 1: The Trust Gap (0:00 - 0:45)**
**Visual:** Quick clips of medical environments, AI interfaces flashing complex clinical recommendations.
**Audio:** "AI is transforming diagnostics, but raw model output often lacks a critical safety net. In clinical settings, trust isn't just about accuracy; it's about alignment with human-centered ethical and safety protocols."
**Visual:** Text overlay: *The Trust Gap in Clinical AI*.
**Audio:** "Introducing **Boofa-Med**: An autonomous clinical protocol auditor built on Google's MedGemma and the Boofa-skiler cognitive architecture."

## **Part 2: The Agentic Workflow (0:45 - 1:45)**
**Visual:** Screen recording of the `demo_app.py` interface. A clinical query is entered.
**Audio:** "Our solution implements an agentic workflow that reimagines the clinical recommendation process. We use **MedGemma** as our primary clinical brain, but we don't stop there."
**Visual:** Diagram showing the recursive loop: MedGemma -> Audit Agent -> Refinement Agent.
**Audio:** "Every recommendation is passed to our **Boofa Auditor Agent**. Using PCA-based anomaly detection and a 6-dimensional Q-Score framework, we score every insight for Grounding, Certainty, and Safety."
**Visual:** The demo UI showing the "Cycle 1: Flagged" then "Cycle 2: Stable" transition.
**Audio:** "If the safety threshold isn't met, the Refinement Agent recursively improves the recommendation until it reaches a stable, high-Q state. This ensures a 'Clinical Singularity' where AI efficiency meets human safety standards."

## **Part 3: The Novel Task - Delta Discovery (1:45 - 2:30)**
**Visual:** Interface highlighting the "Clinical Delta" section.
**Audio:** "Beyond simple recommendations, Boofa-Med tackles the **Novel Task of Clinical Guideline Delta Discovery**. It autonomously identifies discrepancies between legacy practices and new guidelines."
**Visual:** Example showing the "Medication Dosage" update for geriatric patients.
**Audio:** "By flagging these deltas, we prevent operational drift and ensure that clinical teams are always aligned with the latest evidence-based protocols."

## **Part 4: Impact and Scalability (2:30 - 3:00)**
**Visual:** Dashboard showing "Integrated System Q: 1.20+".
**Audio:** "Boofa-Med isn't just a prototype; it's a scalable framework for high-integrity health AI. We're bridging the gap between large-scale medical models and the human-centered requirements of frontline care."
**Visual:** Final logo: *Boofa-Med | Human-Centered AI for the MedGemma Impact Challenge*.
**Audio:** "Join us in bringing high-Q realizations to healthcare. Thank you."
